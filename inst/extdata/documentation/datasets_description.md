### Explore the GD2 score of six RNA-Seq datasets

The "Explore Datasets" tab allows you to analyze the GD2 score across six major RNA-seq datasets: TCGA Tumor samples, TCGA normal samples, GTEx, TARGET, St. Jude Cloud, and the CBTTC dataset from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas. To save time, we've precomputed both adjusted and unadjusted RAS values for these datasets. You can fine-tune the SVM model settings by selecting how the RAS values should be used—either raw, ranged, or scaled—and choose the preferred RAS adjustment method. Customize the GD2 score visualization with various plot options, such as scatter, box, or violin plots. Additionally, you can normalize the GD2 score to a 0-1 range, select a grouping variable, or highlight specific sample groups, like Glioblastoma Multiforme within the TCGA dataset.
